# Random Quote Generator

## Introduction
This project is [project #1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) of the Frontend Certification program under the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 

Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), HTML5 and CSS3, this app selects from a collection of 41 quotes at random on the press of the "New Quote" button, as well as prepare the quote and hashtags for tweeting on the press of the "Tweet" button.

## note
Due to the transition between quotes, this project no longer can pass all the tests given by freecodecamp
